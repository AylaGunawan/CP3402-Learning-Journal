# CP3402 Learning Journal 01
## Week
1
## Learning Activities

Learning activities completed this week include revising web design and development in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. By doing the CP1406 test review, I found out what areas I needed to revisit. Once I was confident, I started designing a website about a startup for Assignment 1.

## Resources & Links

Resources used for learning this week include my own work and online courses. I kept my notes and files from CP1406 so I was able to look back at what I have done in the past and expand on it–I am still proud of my website and, because I upheld good practice, I can use it as reference. To fill in the blanks in my knowledge, I went to [W3Schools’ HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) which offers hands-on exercises, examples and quizzes.

## Estimated Hours

The estimated hours of learning during the week is at least eight (8) hours: one (1) for the CP1406 review, one (1) for research/revision, and six (6) for the startup website. However, the website felt like it took longer as I spent lots of time fiddling with the website to make it look professional.

## Content Insights

From the activities and resources above, insights I gathered are about tools and the theory of web design. With a MacBook, I do not have access to markup-friendly text software. But after some testing, I discovered that PyCharm also provides support and auto-suggestions for HTML and CSS, so I will definitely be using it for this subject. Furthermore, I found it easier to recall general principles of web design because they are founded in the senses of logic and art.

## Career, Employability & Learning Insights

Throughout the week, insights about my career and learning include the importance of records. Going through my old notes with a search function was immensely helpful for revising and I am thankful that I committed to summarising and organising all taught JCU content. In terms of my future employment, recording reduces the buffer time of work. For example, if a job requires me to use HTML after a long time of not using it, I don’t have to waste time relearning it but rather start straight away with my notes to help me. From a different perspective, keeping track of past websites I have made, like in a “portfolio”, would also help me get hired.

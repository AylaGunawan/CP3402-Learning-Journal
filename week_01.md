# CP3402 Learning Journal 01

## Week
1 (06/03/2023)

## Learning Activities

Learning activities completed this week include revising web design and development in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. By doing the CP1406 test review, I found out what areas I needed to revisit in my own time. Once I was confident in my skills again, I designed and constructed a website about an IT startup for Assignment 1 before publishing it on SiteGround for the practical.

## Resources & Links

Resources used for learning this week include my own work and online courses. I kept my notes and files from CP1406 so I was able to look back at what I have done in the past and expand on it--I am still proud of my website and, because I upheld good practice, I was able to use it as reference. To fill the blanks in my knowledge, I went to [W3Schools’ HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) which offers hands-on exercises, examples and quizzes. I also read up on [SiteGround Tutorials](https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/) when I was having difficulties with site caches. For the web content itself, I got assistance from websites such as [Adobe Stock Images](https://stock.adobe.com/au/), [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/#demo) and [This Person Does Not Exist](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en).

## Estimated Hours

The estimated hours of learning during the week is at least eight (8) hours: one (1) for the CP1406 review, one (1) for research/revision, and six (6) for the website creation and hosting. However, the website felt like it took longer as I spent lots of time fiddling with the content to make it look believable and professional.

## Content Insights

From the activities and resources above, insights were gathered about potential web content-making tools and the theory of web design. With a MacBook, I do not have access to markup-friendly text software. But after some testing, I discovered that PyCharm also provides support and auto-suggestions for HTML and CSS, so I took advantage of them. Furthermore, I found it easier to recall general principles of web design because they are founded in the senses of goal-oriented logic and artistic appeal. Also, I experimented a little bit with Bootstrap and GitHub Pages--although I opted to build a website from scratch, there is value in being able to quickly and consistently making and hosting web pages with these platforms.

## Career, Employability & Learning Insights

Throughout the week, insights about my career and learning include the importance of records and time management. Going through my old notes with a search function was immensely helpful for revising and I am thankful that I committed to summarising and organising all taught JCU content. In terms of my future employment, recording reduces the buffer time of work. For example, if a job requires me to use HTML after a long time of not using it, I don’t have to waste time relearning it but rather start straight away with my notes to help me. From a different perspective, keeping track of past websites I have made, like in a “portfolio”, would also help me get hired. On the other hand, spending so much time on a website to make it "perfect" would be detrimental in a real workplace scenario. Next time, I will find more efficient methods for achieving results of similar quality, or just put out a proof-of-concept draft.

As an aside, I did not uphold correct Version Control practices in setting up this learning journal's repository. By next week, I will commit updates from local git.

## Learning Activities

Having no prior experience with CMSs, I focused on learning the basics of Joomla! 4. I found the backend organisation confusing at first--the connections and differences between Articles, Modules and Menus was unclear to me--so I relied on courses, videos and websites that targeted beginners. To apply what I learnt, I set up an experimental branch website on SiteGround, alongside my actual website for submission.

## Resources & Links

* [Joomla! 4 Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/joomla-4-essential-training): A LinkedIn course that teaches the essentials of Joomla. Was not able to finish the entire course (only got up to step 8).
* [How to Build a Website With Joomla 4 | Joomla 4 Beginners Tutorial | Localhost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5VZwTLdgdM): A simplified video tutorial of Joomla I used to inform my experimentation.
* [How to Create Custom CSS with Cassiopeia in Joomla 4](https://ltheme.com/create-custom-css-with-cassiopeia/): A website guide on how to implement custom CSS.

## Estimated Hours

* Two (2) hours on Joomla learning
* Four (4) hours on Joomla experimentation

## Content Insights

Content management systems are valuable for building websites from the ground up by customising pre-fabricated elements. I found there was less overhead as a developer in setting up the core functions of a website than there was when I coded them from scratch (e.g. making a menu bar). Hosting was also straightforward, since Joomla is integrated into many platforms which offer one-click installation. However, the base template is limited in its CSS customisation--for example, Articles by default display with minimum margins, making it difficult to utilise the whole width of the page. This can be circumvented by inserting a user.css file into the template to manually add visual overrides to CSS classes.

## Career, Employability & Learning Insights

Even though Joomla is the second most used non-WYSIWYG CMS, I was only able to find 33 Joomla-related jobs in Australia on [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/joomla-jobs). This is likely due to the success of its WYSIWYG competitors such as Wix, Squarespace, etc. However, being able to access and control both frontend and backend features is important for developers to not only optimise and administrate activity at a finer level, but also to "stand out" from generic drag-and-drop domains. In a real workplace environment, my current workflow would not last; I will not be able to "copy-paste" HTML and CSS content from my previous work as I have done for this practical. In the future, I will prioritise repeatable website construction over brute-forcing overrides just for aesthetic or quality purposes.

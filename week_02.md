## Learning Activities

Having no prior experience with CMSs, I focused on learning the basics of Joomla! 4. I found the terminology and backend organisation confusing at first, trying to understand the connection between Articles and Menus, so I mainly relied on resources for beginners. To apply what I learnt, I made an experimental branch website on SiteGround, alongside my actual website for submission. I also spent time reading about virtual machines like Vagrant, which will be useful for the assignment.

## Content Insights

Content management systems are valuable for building websites from the ground up by customising pre-fabricated elements. I found there was less overhead as a developer in setting up the core functions of a website than there was when I coded them from scratch (e.g. making a menu bar). However, the Joomla-provided template is limited in its CSS customisation. This can be circumvented by adding a user.css file into the template to manually add visual overrides. Virtual machines are for locally hosting servers, mimicking and testing database transfers without the dangers of actually transferring over the internet.

## Career, Employability & Learning Insights

Even though Joomla is the second most used non-WYSIWYG CMS, I was only able to find 33 Joomla-related jobs in Australia on [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/joomla-jobs). This is likely due to the success of its WYSIWYG competitors such as Wix, Squarespace, etc. However, being able to access and control both frontend and backend features is important for developers to not only optimise and administrate activity at a finer level, but also to "stand out" from generic drag-and-drop domains.

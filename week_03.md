# CP3402 Learning Journal 03

## Week
3 (20/03/2023)

## Learning Activities

I learnt WordPress fundamentals through online courses, readings and videos. I then solidified my knowledge by experimenting on two (2) websites with the WordPress CMS: one hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lightsail and the other by SiteGround. I also installed and tested various plugins to understand how they work.

## Resources & Links

## Content Insights

WordPress plugins (and Joomla extensions) are an effective way of adding selective functionality. For example, TranslatePress allows your website to be accessible in various languages by translating web content. Of course, not all websites need every kind of plugin, so being able to install only what you need is useful. I found it easier to set up a WP site on SiteGround than on Lightsail--it only took ten (10) minutes, and it came with default theme content and plugins. However, Lightsail opens up hands-on implementation of SSH and static IPs. Compared to Joomla, WordPress is more intuitive in its site creation due to its block-based layouts.

## Career, Employability & Learning Insights

On [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/joomla-jobs), there are 841 job openings involving WP and 4,511 openings involving AWS--there are even high-profile companies on offer such as Medibank and Amazon Web Servers themselves. By building two (2) websites from the ground up, I got the benefit out of experiencing industry-relevant hosting options and getting more practice with WP. Not all hosting options are equal, however; Lightsail involves back-end customisation and terminal commands while SiteGround does all behind-the-scenes work for you. I believe participating in key DevOps processes builds technical workplace skills more than relying on a "black box".

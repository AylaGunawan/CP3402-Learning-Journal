## Learning Activities

I learnt the basics of website deployment. I read the lecture slides to understand the relationship between deploying environments (production, local development and staging) before doing personal research on local environments. Using Local by Flywheel, I imported my dynamic WordPress website and database, making sure to follow best practices.

## Resources & Links

## Estimated Hours

* Two (2) hours on local development learning
* Two (2) hours on Local by Flywheel experimentation

## Content Insights

Production, local development and staging go hand-in-hand in developer operations. Local development is taking a website offline to perform safe testing and changes. Staging is pushing it to a "middle-man" scenario for a client can interact with. I found it easy to wrap my head around the pushing and pulling of web content because it shares similarities with git. However, I now know in hindsight that my workflow has been production-only and therefore risky. I constantly made big adjustments and overrides to my site which could have broke it--I will try to use Local by Flywheel more to avoid this.

## Career, Employability & Learning Insights

Searching for web developer career openings on [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/web-developer-jobs) gives 3,041 results. However, there are no results for [Local by Flywheel](https://www.seek.com.au/local-flywheel-jobs) and only seven (7) results for [Vagrant](https://www.seek.com.au/vagrant-jobs). Jobs likely don't specify local development requirements, because any software would work as well as the other. However, experience in deployment environments is still critical for working in teams; team members can make changes simultaneously without affecting each other, even without internet access.

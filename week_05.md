# CP3402 Learning Journal 05

## Learning Activities

I learnt about using child themes in WordPress. I went through an online course on LinkedIn to understand the process and conventions of deriving a child from a parent theme and customising template files in CSS and PHP. When I got stuck on concepts like enqueuing stylesheets and hooking functions, I went to official WordPress documentation about child themes and other online readings (glossary and video).

## Resources & Links

* [WordPress: Building Child Themes](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-child-themes-3): LinkedIn course about building child themes in WordPress. Was not able to finish the full course.
* [Developer Resources: Child Themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/): Developer documentation about WordPress child themes.
* [What is: Hooks](https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/hooks/): WordPress glossary on how hooks work in PHP.
* [How to Create a Child Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coLDoM1fQcc): Video on how to make a child theme.

## Estimated Hours

* Three (3) hours on child theme learning and research

## Content Insights

Child themes are useful for detailed customisation of WordPress sites. style.css allows you to override the styling while functions.php allows you to override functions. PHP-wise, filter hooks are for modifying and returning existing outputs while action hooks interact with WordPress to perform complex tasks. These all contribute to make a website more visually and functionally unique from default. Also, updating a theme's version will erase any changes made to the parent but not to the child, making the site more secure and robust.

## Career, Employability & Learning Insights

According to the career profile on [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/role/devops-engineer), DevOps Engineers in Australia earn between $125K to $145K a year. There are 2,063 jobs available, and it is projected to grow by 27% in the next five (5) years. Some skills/tools that are sought after include pipelines (which would include child themes), deployment, Linux, AWS, Python, Java and Powershell. CP3402, alongside other IT subjects, has equipped me with these important technical tools to apply in the workplace.

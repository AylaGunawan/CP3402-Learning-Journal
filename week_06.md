## Learning Activities

I learnt about project management in the context of IT startups for the group assignment. I watched three (3) courses on LinkedIn: _Agile at Work: Driving Productive Agile Meetings_ to learn about communication and collaboration in a team, and _Agile Project Management: Comparing Agile Tools_ and _Trello for Agile Teams_ to learn about helpful sites/software such as Trello, Jira, etc.

## Content Insights

Stand-up meetings are good for efficiently and effectively tracking progress as a team. It forces people to only stay on-topic and to-the-point, making for an overall more productive session. The idea that roadblocks that can be solved in less than five (5) minutes should be solved in that time also maximises the value of this meeting regime, allowing all team members to keep moving even if they were stuck. The success of a project comes down to clear and consistent organisation and communication. This is a struggle for me as I am very independent and hesitate to contact teammates in fear of bothering them, trying to do as much as I can on my own instead.

## Career, Employability & Learning Insights

On [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/project-management-jobs), there are 23,087 jobs for project management, 7,817 of which are [IT-related](https://www.seek.com.au/it-project-management-jobs). This makes sense because for IT companies whose team members are often in remote locations, they need some form of organisation, structure and accountability in order to work effectively. As for [the career profile of IT Project Managers](https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/role/information-technology-project-manager), their salary is between $125K and $145K and their job growth rate is 17.7%. Interestingly, recommended qualifications include a Bachelor of Information Technology, which is the course I am taking now, so this career path is viable for me.

## Learning Activities

I learnt about PHP fundamentals. I watched _PHP Essential Training_ and _PHP with MySQL Essential Training_ by Kevin Skoglund, who taught both coding basics (i.e. decisions, repetitions, functions) and PHP specifics (i.e. super globals, syntax). Although the first course was easy because I have dabbled in PHP before, the latter was harder to follow, so I had to do extra research on things like operators and the MySQL language.

## Content Insights

PHP is a language designed for backend web development. It dynamically delivers web content based on server-side information such as databases, access, cookies, etc. The "include" command lets developers modularise parts of the site hierarchy such as headers and footers. This centralises the code and speeds up the workflow, which would be efficient for building a custom WordPress theme. However, it is only viable when hosted on a remote or local server. Luckily, the PHPStorm IDE has a feature for easily local-hosting .php scripts without any virtual machines so that changes can be made in real time. 

## Career, Employability & Learning Insights

There are 2,235 PHP-related jobs on [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/php-jobs). On the [PHP developer career profile](https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/role/php-developer), job growth is at 27% over the next 5 years, getting $100K-$115K in annual salary. Also, allegedly 80% of all websites use some form of PHP. One of the recommendations in becoming a PHP developer is to get an internship while pursuing a Bachelor-level degree. I don't plan on getting an internship, but I see the value in gathering as much workplace experience as you can.

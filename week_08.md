## Learning Activities

I performed a learning experiment around my learning of custom WordPress themes. In the past weeks, I have been watching LinkedIn courses at x2 speed, skipping parts to get straight to the code due to time constraints. However, these choices could be hindering my learning, so I decided to test it. I referred to a website for a basic experiment structure.

My theory is that watching at a slower speed without skips will solidify my knowledge more than watching at x2 speed with skips. This can be tested by doing both processes on similar material, writing what I remember afterwards and comparing my notes. I applied this experiment as I watched the LinkedIn course _WordPress: Building Themes from Scratch Using Underscores_ by Morten Rand-Hendriksen. More specifically, I went through _3. Set Up a Basic Theme_ at x1 speed and _4. Build the Header_ at x2 speed.

## Learning Activities

I performed a learning experiment around my learning of custom WordPress themes. In the past weeks, I have been watching LinkedIn courses at x2 speed, skipping parts to get straight to the code due to time constraints. However, these choices could be hindering my learning, so I decided to test it. I referred to a website for a basic experiment structure.

My theory is that watching at a slower speed without skips will solidify my knowledge more than watching at x2 speed with skips. This can be tested by doing both processes on similar material, writing what I remember afterwards and comparing my notes. I applied this experiment as I watched the LinkedIn course _WordPress: Building Themes from Scratch Using Underscores_ by Morten Rand-Hendriksen. More specifically, I went through _3. Set Up a Basic Theme_ at x2 speed and _4. Build the Header_ at x1 speed.

## Resources & Links

* [WordPress: Building Themes from Scratch Using Underscores](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-themes-from-scratch-using-underscores-2/welcome?autoplay=true): LinkedIn course for making custom themes in WordPress from starter _s. Did not finish full course.
* [How to Write up a Science Experiment](https://www.wikihow.com/Write-up-a-Science-Experiment): Website guide for writing an experiment report.

## Estimated Hours

* Four (4) hours of custom theme learning.
* Four (4) hours (coinciding) of learning experimentation.

## Content Insights

>_3. Set Up a Basic Theme:_
>* Use the function _setup in functions.php to enqueue styles
>* A source map is an association array that tracks which Sass files affect which rules of the main CSS file
>* Responsive layouts can be made from scratch by importing/hooking up a new .scss file in style.scss

>_4. Build the Header:_
>* Relevant files include header.php, custom-header.php in inc, header.scss and functions.php (to edit header and logo upload sizes)
>* There is such thing as pseudo-elements i.e. before and after. However, these clearings are not present in the newest iteration of the _s starter theme
>* A website's front page is the page at its root URL (of which the default can be changed) while its home is its index.php page

From these findings, my theory can be concluded to be correct. Watching a video at x2 forces me to look at "bigger picture" concepts and tips while x1 speed allows me to absorb information with more detail. However, whether the latter is more beneficial is up for debate. I finished section 3 in roughly 1.5 hours and section 4 in 2.5 hours, so I believe the time wasted is not worth the extra detail. In any case, learning experiments are a good way to gain personal insight on workflow in a controlled, evidential setting.

## Career, Employability & Learning Insights

Underscores or _s is a WordPress-supported "launchpad" for constructing custom themes. As explained by [ThemeShaper](https://themeshaper.com/2012/02/13/introducing-the-underscores-theme/), the _s starter them gives developers an 1000-hour head. It is constantly updated and is the best industry-standard option for tailoring a website to a client's needs while avoiding wasted effort. To test if a custom theme "covers all the bases", the [WordPress codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test) provides a theme unit test with pages, posts and other features. This prevents developers from building a theme around a specific client's content, making it non-repeatable and unusable by anyone else.

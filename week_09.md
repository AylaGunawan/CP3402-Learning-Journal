# CP3402 Learning Journal 09

## Week
9 (08/05/2023)

## Learning Activities

I learnt about Sass and Gulp by watching LinkedIn courses such as _Sass Essential Training_ and reading official documentation. I also continued watching _WordPress: Building Themes from Scratch Using Underscores_ from last week because of its information on Gulp. Although learning Sass was straightforward to me, Gulp was less so because the videos are outdated, forcing me to debug the code materials most of the time.

## Learning Activities

I learnt about Sass and Gulp by watching LinkedIn courses such as _Sass Essential Training_ and reading official documentation. I also continued watching _WordPress: Building Themes from Scratch Using Underscores_ from last week because of its information on Gulp. Although learning Sass was straightforward because of my previous experience with CSS, Gulp was less so because the videos are outdated, forcing me to debug the code materials most of the time.

## Resources & Links

* [WordPress: Building Themes from Scratch Using Underscores](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-themes-from-scratch-using-underscores-2/welcome?autoplay=true): LinkedIn course for making custom themes with Sass and Gulp. Did not finish full course.

## Estimated Hours

* Two (2) hours of Sass learning.
* Two (2) hours of Gulp learning.

## Content Insights

Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets or Sass is a metalanguage that optimises frontend development. By integrating code conventions like variables, nesting and modular components, it organises CSS styling by the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. The difference between mixins and extends is that the prior "copy-pastes" its rules wherever it is included while the latter groups its rules in one (1) selector, making for shorter code. PHPStorm supports the translation of .scss to .css via File Watchers and mapping files which is useful. In my opinion, Sass should be introduced to beginners earlier because CSS' lack of inheritance forces devs to duplicate their work which is error-prone and time-inefficient.

## Career, Employability & Learning Insights

Task runners, such as Gulp, are tools that automate file processing and observation. It is a customisable alternative to using Sass in the command-line or relying on IDEs. However, I only discovered recently that the course I have been following not only is outdated, but has been replaced twice in the last five (5) years. Technology evolves quickly and I will need to keep my knowledge up-to-date to stay relevant in the workforce. On Seek, there are also [563 frontend developer jobs](https://www.seek.com.au/frontend-developer-jobs), as opposed to [331 backend developer jobs](https://www.seek.com.au/backend-developer-jobs). This demand for frontend over backend surprises me as it implies that employers care about presentation to the user over the dev, making a Sass-y workflow all the more important.

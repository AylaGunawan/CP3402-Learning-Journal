## Learning Activities

I learnt about careers and AI in IT. In modern times, artificial intelligence is becoming more capable of substituting for human jobs like coding and writing. I have avoided ChatGPT in my work, but it is possible that I am missing out on a beneficial tool that will be prevalent in future workplaces. I also learnt about custom page templates for WordPress.

I performed a learning experiment where me and ChatGPT will perform the same two (2) prompts: one (1) in coding and one (1) in writing. The results of these prompts will be presented to surveyees who will choose which they think is higher in quality. My hypothesis is that ChatGPT will be lower-quality in both coding and writing. I will know I am right when the majority of surveyees pick human  over AI.

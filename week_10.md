## Learning Activities

I learnt about custom page templates in WordPress and AI. In modern times, artificial intelligence is becoming more capable of substituting for human activities like coding and writing. I have avoided ChatGPT in my work, but it is possible that I am missing out on a beneficial tool.

I performed a learning experiment where me and ChatGPT will perform the same two (2) prompts: one (1) in coding and one (1) in writing. The results of these prompts will be presented to surveyees who will choose which they think is higher in quality. My hypothesis is that ChatGPT will be lower-quality in both coding and writing. I will know I am right when the majority of surveyees pick human  over AI.

## Learning Activities

I learnt about careers and AI in IT. In modern times, artificial intelligence is becoming more capable of substituting for human jobs like writing. I have mostly avoided _ChatGPT_ in my work, but it is possible that I am missing out on a beneficial tool that will become prevalent in future workplaces. I also learnt about templates files for _WordPress_ in-depth.

I performed a learning experiment where _ChatGPT_ and I follow the same writing prompt. The results of the prompt will be presented to surveyees who will choose which they think performs better evaluation-wise. My hypothesis is that _ChatGPT's_ result will be lower in evaluative value - that is, assessing the worth of something based on evidence. I will know I am right when the majority of surveyees pick human over AI.

## Content Insights

### Writing Prompt

Write an evaluative paragraph on how template files are useful when building a custom _WordPress_ theme in under 100 words.

> Human: 3/3 votes

> Template files are good for flexible and reusable code structure of elements in a custom WordPress theme. Being able to change the functionality and formatting of sections of a site on a "page-by-page" basis helps in tailoring a website to the client's goals. For example, I was able to make custom page templates that used the query loop like an archive. Because of the template hierarchy, WordPress recognises filename prefixes (e.g. "page-" or "category-"), making the overriding of default layouts seamless. Using template files also centralises the code for a consistent workflow with less maintenance burden and human error.

> _ChatGPT:_ 0/3 votes

> Template files are indispensable when constructing a custom WordPress theme. They provide a structured framework for organizing and displaying content, allowing developers to create consistent and dynamic layouts. With template files, designers can easily customize the appearance and functionality of different pages, posts, and archives. By separating design elements from the underlying code, template files enhance maintainability and facilitate collaboration between designers and developers. They play a crucial role in building a cohesive and professional WordPress theme, enabling efficient customization and seamless content presentation.

These results prove my hypothesis that AI is still unable to match the human's capacity to evaluate. Interestingly, when surveyees were later asked to identify which of the results was written by _ChatGPT_, they all thought it was my paragraph due to its use of terminology and examples, saying it was "more systematic and less like an essay". This implies that people may already hold a high expectation of AI despite its lack of real experience to draw evaluations from.

## Career, Employability & Learning Insights

In the future, people in the IT industry will compete with both human and artificial workforces. Though my learning experiment was on a small scale, it shows the general populace is receptive of AI replacing previously human-exclusive tasks. AI will only improve with time, leaving supervision/training jobs to IT workers. On [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/artificial-intelligence-jobs), there are already 312 AI-based jobs, mostly for data mining and machine learning.

However, soft skills like communication and teamwork will continue to stay relevant since they are about human connections, of which cannot be automated. CP3402 has challenged me to improve in this area especially. For example, I exercised leadership in the group assignment, becoming an evaluator of teammates' work and using project management tools. I hope to turn these skills into strengths so that my employability is based on my work ethic/experience more than my easily-disposable technical expertise.
